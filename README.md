SLYEngine V1.0.0 - Developed by SLY

A simple 2D Game Engine written in Java

SLYEngine comes with a simple player built in to show how to setup gameobjects and basic player movement. Collision is not built into the engine so you will have to come up with a solution for colliding with objects. This is a very simple engine that is designed to be built upon and modified so that when there is a limitation you can just modify the engine code to fix the limitation. SLYEngine is based off of Majoolwips Game Engine. This engine is an excellent starting platform for coding 2D games with Java.

Feel free to use the Game Engine to develop your own games and distribute them, however you are not allowed to rebrand the engine or distribute the engine without significant modifications.
